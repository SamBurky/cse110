My name is Samuel Burkholder and this is my github practice page for CSE 110. I look forward to learning a lot this quarter, but here's some about me.
I grew up running and playing soccer. I play chess and do rubik's cubes as well.

**Favorite coding language:**

*I like Java because I learned it first.*

~~I like Javascript because it is awesome.~~

**I was born in _January_ of 2000**

***Which means I can legally drink later this month!***

> No I'm not. I'm fine.

I use `ls` at least 3 times as often as I use any other terminal command!
